# Crowdsim2 

- CrowdSensim2.py refactered and added two new mobility models. Namely, the Social Influence model and the Stochastic model.
- run.py contains the classes for the Social Mobility model.
- tasks.py contains the classes for task evaluation.
- Simulation.cc refactered to fix the mobile transmissions for the different mobility models.
- setup.txt accepts new paramters such as the mobility model and the maximum number of routes per user.

Please make sure to bring all of these files into the crowdsensim main folder. 
Except for the Simulation.cc which should be place in the src folder.
